We’ll talk about the three unique Next.js functions you can use to fetch data for pre-rendering:

    getStaticProps (Static Generation): Fetch data at build time.
    getStaticPaths (Static Generation): Specify dynamic routes to pre-render pages based on data.
    getServerSideProps (Server-side Rendering): Fetch data on each request.

In addition, we’ll talk briefly about how to fetch data on the client side.
